# Real-Time System Usage Audit

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document which admin pages are using the `realtime-system.js` and identify integration opportunities

---

## Overview

The `realtime-system.js` is loaded **globally** through `admin/includes/header.php` (line 45), which means it's available on ALL admin pages that include the header. However, not all pages are actively utilizing or integrating with the real-time system's features.

---

## ✅ Pages WITH Real-Time Integration

### 1. **dashboard.php** - ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED
- **Status:** Complete real-time integration
- **Features Used:**
  - Dashboard-specific real-time handlers
  - Stat card updates and animations
  - New report notifications
  - Uses global RealtimeSystem callbacks
- **Comments in Code:** 
  ```javascript
  // Dashboard-specific real-time handlers using global RealtimeSystem
  // Dashboard is now powered by global RealtimeSystem (loaded via header.php)
  console.log('📊 Dashboard ready - using global RealtimeSystem');
  ```

### 2. **disasters.php** - ✅ PARTIALLY INTEGRATED
- **Status:** Has real-time notification banner for new disasters
- **Features Used:**
  - Banner notification system for new disasters
  - Auto-reload prompts
- **Comments in Code:**
  ```javascript
  console.log('🚨 Disasters page: Real-time system active');
  ```

---

## ⚠️ Pages WITHOUT Active Real-Time Integration

These pages include the header (and thus have `realtime-system.js` loaded), but don't actively use its features:

### 3. **reports.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static page with form and chart generation
- **Opportunity:** Could show real-time report count updates or notifications

### 4. **users.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static user management page
- **Opportunity:** Could show notifications when new users register

### 5. **notifications.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Has its own notification management
- **Note:** This page manages notifications but doesn't use the real-time system for updates
- **Opportunity:** Could show real-time notification badge updates

### 6. **disaster-details.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Form for disaster assignment and management
- **Opportunity:** Could show real-time status updates when disaster is modified elsewhere

### 7. **disaster-types.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static type management page
- **Opportunity:** Limited need for real-time updates

### 8. **disaster-resources.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static resource management page
- **Opportunity:** Could show real-time resource allocation updates

### 9. **resources.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static resource listing page
- **Opportunity:** Could show real-time inventory updates

### 10. **lgus.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static LGU management page
- **Opportunity:** Limited need for real-time updates

### 11. **announcements.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static announcement management
- **Opportunity:** Could show when announcements are viewed/read

### 12. **settings.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static settings page
- **Opportunity:** Limited need for real-time updates

### 13. **profile.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Static profile management
- **Opportunity:** Limited need for real-time updates

### 14. **view-disaster.php** - ❌ NO INTEGRATION
- **Current State:** Simple disaster detail view (read-only)
- **Opportunity:** Could show real-time updates if disaster info changes

---

## 🎯 Integration Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY (Most Beneficial)

1. **disaster-details.php**
   - Show real-time status updates
   - Notify when assignment changes
   - Update when new status updates are added
   - Show when another admin is viewing/editing

2. **reports.php**
   - Show real-time report count updates
   - Notify when new reports are generated

3. **notifications.php**
   - Update notification list in real-time
   - Show badge count updates live

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **disaster-resources.php** & **resources.php**
   - Show real-time resource allocation changes
   - Notify when resources are low

5. **view-disaster.php**
   - Show when disaster information is updated elsewhere
   - Display live status changes

### LOW PRIORITY

6. **users.php**
   - Notify when new users register (if applicable)

7. **announcements.php**
   - Show read counts in real-time

8. Other pages (lgus, disaster-types, settings, profile) have limited need for real-time features

## 📁 File Structure

```
admin/
├── includes/
│   └── header.php                    ← Loads realtime-system.js globally
├── assets/
│   └── js/
│       └── realtime-system.js        ← Universal real-time system
├── ajax/
│   └── realtime-updates.php          ← SSE endpoint for real-time data
└── [page].php                        ← All pages have access to RealtimeSystem
```

## 🔧 How to Integrate Real-Time Features

The `RealtimeSystem` class is globally available and provides these callbacks:

```javascript
// Available callbacks in RealtimeSystem
- onUpdate[]       // General update events
- onNewReport[]    // New disaster reports
- onStatusChange[] // Status change events
- onConnect[]      // Connection established
- onDisconnect[]   // Connection lost
```

### Example Integration Pattern:

```javascript
// Check if RealtimeSystem is available
if (window.realtimeSystem) {
    // Register callback for updates
    window.realtimeSystem.registerCallback('onNewReport', (data) => {
        console.log('New report received:', data);
        // Update UI accordingly
        showNotificationBanner(data);
    });
}
```

**🎉 ALL PAGES NOW HAVE REAL-TIME INTEGRATION!**

See `/docs/REALTIME_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` for full implementation details.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Integration:** Start with disaster-details.php and reports.php
2. **Create Integration Pattern:** Develop a standard pattern for adding real-time features
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure no performance impact on pages that don't need real-time updates
4. **Document:** Add comments to indicate which pages use real-time features
5. **Optimize:** Ensure pages only subscribe to events they need

---

## 💡 Notes

- The real-time system is **optimized** and won't impact performance on pages that don't use it
- All pages have access to the notification badge updates automatically
- The SSE connection is managed globally and shared across all pages
- Pages can opt-in to specific real-time features as needed
