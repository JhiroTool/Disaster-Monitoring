# Priority Logic & Completed Disasters Fix

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Issue:** Completed disasters still showing in emergency reports list  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### **Issue 1: Completed Disasters Visible**
Completed disasters were showing in the main Emergency Reports list, cluttering the view with resolved incidents.

### **Issue 2: Incorrect Statistics**
Statistics were counting ALL disasters including completed ones, making it hard to see actual active emergencies.

### **Issue 3: Priority Logic**
Critical disasters that were already completed were still being counted as "Critical" in stats.

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### **1. Default Behavior Changed**

**BEFORE:**
```
Shows: All disasters (including completed)
Result: Cluttered list with resolved incidents
```

**AFTER:**
```
Shows: Only active disasters (ON GOING, IN PROGRESS)
Result: Clean list showing only current emergencies
```

### **2. Smart Filtering Added**

**New Filter Options:**
- ✅ **"Active Reports"** (default) - Excludes completed
- ✅ **"On Going"** - Only new reports awaiting response
- ✅ **"In Progress"** - Only reports being handled
- ✅ **"Completed Only"** - View completed reports archive
- ✅ **"Include Completed" checkbox** - Show all reports

## 🎯 Updated Statistics

### **BEFORE:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Total: 150    │ Critical: 25       │
│ Pending: 20   │ Overdue: 5         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
└─ Included completed disasters
```

### **AFTER (Default View):**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Active: 100   │ Critical Active: 15 │ On Going: 50  │
│ In Progress: 45 │ Overdue: 5                        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
└─ Shows only active disasters
```

### **AFTER (With Completed):**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Total: 150    │ Critical Active: 15 │ On Going: 50  │
│ In Progress: 45 │ Completed: 50                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
└─ Shows all disasters when checkbox enabled
```

## 💻 Code Changes

### **1. Updated Query Logic**

```php
// BEFORE
$where_clause = !empty($where_conditions) ? 
    'WHERE ' . implode(' AND ', $where_conditions) : '';

// AFTER
// Exclude completed by default unless explicitly requested
if ($status_filter === 'COMPLETED' || $show_completed === '1') {
    // Show completed disasters
} else {
    // Exclude completed disasters by default
    $where_conditions[] = "d.status != 'COMPLETED'";
}
```

### **2. Updated Statistics**

```php
// BEFORE
count(array_filter($disasters, fn($d) => $d['priority'] === 'critical'))

// AFTER
count(array_filter($disasters, fn($d) => 
    $d['priority'] === 'critical' && $d['status'] !== 'COMPLETED'
))
```

### **3. Added Smart Indicators**

```php
// Info banner when showing active only
<?php if ($show_completed !== '1' && empty($status_filter)): ?>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        Showing Active Reports Only - Completed disasters are hidden
    </div>
<?php endif; ?>
```

## 🎯 Priority Logic Details

### **Critical Priority**
**Old Logic:**
```php
$d['priority'] === 'critical'  // Includes completed
```

**New Logic:**
```php
$d['priority'] === 'critical' && $d['status'] !== 'COMPLETED'
// Only counts active critical disasters
```

### **Why This Matters:**
- A completed disaster is no longer critical
- Statistics should reflect current threat level
- Resource allocation based on active priorities
- Dashboard shows real-time emergency status

- ✅ Checkbox filter works on touch

4. **Restore Option** - Reopen completed disasters if needed
