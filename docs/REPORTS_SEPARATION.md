**Access:**
- URL: `/my_reports.php`
- Restricted to: Logged-in reporters only
- Non-reporters redirected to login page

**Changes:**
- ❌ Removed "My Emergency Reports" section (moved to `my_reports.php`)

- ❌ Removed accordion styles and JavaScript
- ❌ Removed divider between sections
- ✅ Kept tracking form and functionality

### 3. Updated: `includes/public_nav.php`

**Changes:**
- Updated "View All My Reports" link: `track_report.php` → `my_reports.php`
- Updated "Track Specific Report" link text to "Track Report by ID"
- Link now points directly to `track_report.php` (no hash anchor)

**Reporter Dropdown Menu:**
```
Quick Actions

├─ View All My Reports → my_reports.php (NEW)
└─ Track Report by ID → track_report.php
