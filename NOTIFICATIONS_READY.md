## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Login to Admin Panel**
   - Go to: `http://localhost/Disaster-Monitoring/admin/login.php`
   - Login with username: `admin` or `Admin_01`
   - Look for the bell icon 🔔 with (37) badge

## 📝 Notification Details

Each notification includes:
- ✅ Disaster type (Typhoon, Flood, Earthquake, etc.)
- ✅ Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- ✅ Location (City, Province, State)
- ✅ Severity level
- ✅ Current status
- ✅ Tracking ID (clickable link)
- ✅ Timestamp (time ago format)

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The issue was that the `notification_helper.php` was trying to access a `region` column that doesn't exist in your database. The table uses:
- `city` - City name
- `province` - Province name  
- `state` - State/Region name

I updated the query to use the correct columns:
```php
CONCAT(COALESCE(d.city, ''), ', ', COALESCE(d.province, ''), ', ', COALESCE(d.state, ''))
```
